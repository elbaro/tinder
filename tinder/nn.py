class WeightScale(nn.Module):
    """A weight normalizing layer used in PGGAN.

    How it works:

        1. Initialize your ConvLayer with weights from N(0, std=kaiming)
        2. WeightScale calculates the initial std of weights (from 1)
        3. Divide Conv.weights by std (from 2). Now Conv.weights are ~N(0,1)
        4. On forward, WeightScale multiply the input by std (from 2).
        5. Bias or Activation is applied after WeightScale. If Conv has bias, WeightScale steals it.

    Note that the scale factor calculated in 2 is constant permanently.

    Advantage:

        The author of PGGAN claims Adam is better at training weights in N(0,1) than training conv weights of different std.

    Example::

        conv = nn.Conv2d(3, 64, kernel_size=3, padding=1)
        ws = WeightScale(conv)
        nn.Sequential(
            conv,
            ws
        )
